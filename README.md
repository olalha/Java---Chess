# Java Chess
The following is my Internal Assessment (AI) for Computer Science for which I was awarded a 7 (A*) whilst I was a student of the International Baccalaureate (IB )program. This project involved formal planning, design and communication with a client in additional to producing a working product.
 
The project had to follow strict guidelines outlined by the IB regarding the IA for computer science. The **[Documentation]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/tree/master/Documentation)** directory contains all relevant information about the project.

- **[Criterion A]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20A.pdf)**
	- Rational for the project
	- Requirements from client
- **[Criterion B]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20B.pdf)**
	- Outlines the design
		- GUI sketches
		- Flow charts
		- Pseudo code
- **[Criterion C]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20C.pdf)**
	- Explanation of the program structure
		- UML Class diagram
		- Description of key concepts
- **[Criterion D]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20D.mp4)**
	- A video displaying the finished product
- **[Criterion E]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20E.pdf)**
	- Evaluation of project execution
- **[Appendix 1]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Appendix%201.pdf)**
	- Initial communication with the client
- **[Appendix 2]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Appendix%202.pdf)**
	- Final communication with the client
- **[ROT]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/ROT.pdf)**
	- Record of tasks performed

## Functionality
The source code can be found in the **[src]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/tree/master/src)** directory. The executable file in named **[chess]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Chess.jar)**. If you do not have a Java VM installed or have problems running the executable, consider watching the video titled **[Criterion D]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/blob/master/Documentation/Criterion%20D.mp4)** in the **[Documentation]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/tree/master/Documentation)** folder, which showcases the program.

This is a simple chess game that implements a GUI. Noteworthy functionality may include the ability to save the game state, undo moves and detect the occurrence of check/checkmate. Please refer to the **[Documentation]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/tree/master/Documentation)** for further information on the design and functionality of the program.

## Comments
The source code contains an excessive number of comments as this was required by the IB.
