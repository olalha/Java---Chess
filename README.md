# Java Chess
The following is my Internal Assessment (AI) for Computer Science for which I was awarded a 7 (A*) whilst I was a student of the International Baccalaureate (IB )program. This project involved formal planning, design and communication with a client in additional to producing a working product.
 
The project had to follow strict guidelines outlined by the IB regarding the IA for computer science. The **[Documentation]( https://github.com/olalha/Java---Chess/tree/master/Documentation)** directory contains all relevant information about the project.

- **Criterion A**
	- Rational for the project
	- Requirements from client
- **Criterion B**
	- Outlines the design
		- GUI sketches
		- Flow charts
		- Pseudo code
- **Criterion C**
	- Explanation of the program structure
		- UML Class diagram
		- Description of key concepts
- **Criterion D**
	- A video displaying the finished product
- **Criterion E**
	- Evaluation of project execution
- **Appendix 1-2**
	- Communication with the client
- **ROT**
	- Record of tasks performed

## Functionality
The source code can be found in the **src** directory. The executable file in named **chess**. If you do not have a Java VM installed or have problems running the executable, consider watching the video titled **Criterion D** in the **Documentation** folder, which showcases the program.

This is a simple chess game that implements a GUI. Noteworthy functionality may include the ability to save the game state, undo moves and detect the occurrence of check/checkmate. Please refer to the **Documentation** for further information on the design and functionality of the program.

## Comments
The source code contains an excessive amount of comments as this was required by the IB.
